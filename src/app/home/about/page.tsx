        My name is Hemant Kushwaha, and Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Master of Science in Information Systems at UMD, 
        where I also serve as the Track Representative for the Spring 2025 cohort. 
        In the past, I worked as a software developer in India for 41 months, 
        where I honed my problem-solving and organizational skills in a fast-paced, team-oriented environment. 
        During my undergraduate years, I took on various leadership roles in the college fest organizing team, 
        including core coordinator, event manager, coordinator, and volunteer. Additionally, I was a coordinator of a dramatics club.
